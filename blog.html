                                <p class="card-text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to change many parts of our lives, offering lots of good things. But alongside these good things, there are also some worries we need to think about.
                                One big worry is that AI might take away jobs and make it hard for people to find work. It can do tasks that people used to do, so there's a chance that many people might lose their jobs. This could cause big problems for families and make it tough for people to earn money.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">The Importance of Learning Programming</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">Understanding how computers work is another benefit of learning programming. You get to peek behind the curtain and see how all the technology around us actually functions. This knowledge helps you make smarter choices about the tech you use every day.
                                And when you learn to write code, you become aware of the challenges that come with it. You realize that things don't always work perfectly the first time, and that's okay. You learn to be patient and persistent, which are important qualities to have in life.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">Why Laptops Are More Expensive</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">Laptops cost more because their compact design, integrated components, durability, portability, battery technology, and the innovation behind them all contribute to higher manufacturing expenses, which are reflected in their price tags. Additionally, the engineering required to ensure performance in a smaller form factor and the research and development invested in advancing laptop technology also add to their overall cost.</p>
